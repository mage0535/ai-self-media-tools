## Runtime drift

- Current release: `/root/.ai-self-media-tools-releases/unified-capability-v7-149362f`
- GitHub feature branch: `149362f`
- GitHub main: `b059d07`
- Local checkout at audit time: `f625eeb`
- Server dirty checkout: `6f4c88a` plus modified and untracked files
- Private config `data_dir`: `/root/.ai-self-media-tools-releases/aebd7a9/data` (invalid production coupling)
- Current release contains no `config.json`.
- MCP fallback database: current release `data/state.db`.
- Shared production database: `/root/.ai-self-media-tools/data/state.db`.

## Hermes execution evidence

- Telegram session history: 544 messages, approximately 400k input tokens, 206 tool turns.
- Hermes created `/root/.hermes/scripts/clear_workflow_lock.py` and directly deleted `workflow_locks`.
